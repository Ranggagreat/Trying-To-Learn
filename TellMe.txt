we talk, we chat, we skype that day
you talk, i hear what you have to say
you com-plain 'bout your boyfriend's mistake
and in the end i gave you an advice that i make
we stop, i don't know why the heck we did
we grow apart at that time we did
then we're going to the same school
and here i grin, from my ear to ear

but it didn't work the way i thought
i see that you've changed a lot
and you brush me off like you don't know me
am i that forgettable to you? just tell me

did you value our friendship that much?
i liked you, but now i think you're just too much
whatever happened to the trust that you've given me?
am i just a stranger to you now? oh god, just tell me
tell me why, tell me why you acted like you don't know me?
tell me why, tell me why
