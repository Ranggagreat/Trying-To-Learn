[Verse 1]
Things that were broken, things that were not
Things that were fine, i see this a lot
Hold one of the broken here in my arms
Stop ticking it does, no more alarms
She gave it to me but i broke it
Her gifts and her trust, at the time i did
Spur of the moment, heat of the fight
Can't take it no more, end it downright

But what can i do
All i can say is you
Will always be in this brain of mine
Now i remember again when this is fine
I said 

[Hook]
Your beauty, no one can beat
Your smartness makes me obsolete
You're dilligent, inspirational
Your smile is so irrational
You're kind and that's all i really need
You're funny from the first time we meet
Perfection is what you are, my lady
Have i told you that i love you lately?

[Verse 2]
Hah,
I used to say that, now, didn't i?
Now the only thing i do is whining, i
may have just chose the wrong decision
I did caught you crying in my line of vision
regret did always comes last
but i did this once and now i won't change
have to believe in my own decision
hope we're now going in rescission
no repercussion on this division

I now have another girl to love
but i'm doomed forever in the friendzone
is this karma for getting rid the girl i'm tired of?
if this is, i'm not going to atone
I remember

[Hook II]
Her beauty, no one can beat
Her smartness, makes me obsolete
Her diligentness, inspirational
Her smile is so irrational
Her kindness is all i really need
Her laugh from the first time we meet
Perfection is what she was, and lastly
Should i told her that i love her lately?

[Verse 3]
I shouldn't though
All i'm going to get is "I'm sorry, 'cause.."
then they say all this bullshit reasons
saying that they want to be friends, freeze in
my heart and i can't feel no warmthness
shut my eyes, all i see is darkness
creeping up, feeling the loneliness
showing up, descending to madness

[Bridge]
And now it's been five years since i've done that thing
Now all i see is happy singles and casual fling
Famous people saying shit and sing
And what i want is to be mating
Formal; intercourse, Informal; sex
But women avoid me like im under hex
I'm turning seventeen soon and im sick of
Betrayals cheatings all i want i love
I hope

[Hook III]
Her beauty, no one can ever beat
Her smartness, makes me more obsolete
Her diligentness, sensational
Her smile should be irrational
Her kindness will be the thing i seek
Her wild jokes will hurt my cheek
Perfection is what she should, and tell me
Where she was, i'm wondering lately?
