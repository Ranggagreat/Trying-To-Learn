Same life but it feels just a little bit different now
Sad song on the radio but now it's relatable
When my friend talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when he said your name

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to movie places
'Cause all you wanted to do was watch
Now you're watching movies
But you're watching with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, well-timed chances to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to said things i should've said, ohh…
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to movie places
'Cause all you wanted to do was watch
Now you're watching movies
But you're watching with another man

Although it hurts
I'll do the things i should've done long time ago
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and said the things that i should've said
But I just want to let you go

And I hope he buys you flowers
And I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to movie places
'Cause I remember how much you loved to watch
Do all the things I should have done
When I could be your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I could be your man
