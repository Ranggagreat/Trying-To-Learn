[Verse 1]
Despair
If you said it happily, it's just another word
Suicide
If you didn't try to do it, it's just another word
Anger
If you didn't punch anyone, it's just another word
and Hurt
If you never felt it, you're totally lying

[Reff I]
Emotions runs amok inside this head
It's confused but it is mainly sad
'Doubt' is filling my head and it's bad
But if you take it easy
It's just another word

[Verse 2]
Jealous
If you didn't get overprotective, it's just another word
Love
If you didn't stalk them, it's just another word
Death
If you're still healthy, it's just another word
and Stress
If you never felt it, you're goddamn lying

[Reff II]
Emotions runs again inside this head
When i see you with him it makes me sad
'Brokenhearted' is what i felt and it's bad
But if you just start moving on
It's just another word

[Bridge]
